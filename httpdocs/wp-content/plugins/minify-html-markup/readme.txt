Minify HTML output for clean looking markup and faster downloading.


== Description ==

Ever look at the HTML markup of your website and notice how sloppy and amateurish it looks? The Minify HTML plugin cleans up sloppy looking markup and minifies, which also speeds up download time.

Make your website's markup look professional by using Minify HTML. Easy to use, simply install and activate (with additional options for advanced settings).

Minify HTML also has optional specialized minification for JavaScript and internal CSS. It doesn't mess with your textareas or preformatted text.

Settings options to removes HTML, CSS and JavaScript comments (leaving MSIE conditional comments), remove unneeded XHTML closing tags from HTML5 void elements and remove unneeded relative schemes and domains from links.


== Installation ==

= For an automatic installation through WordPress: =

1. Select **Add New** from the WordPress **Plugins** menu in the admin area.
2. Search for **Minify HTML**.
3. Click **Install Now**, then **Activate Plugin**.

= For manual installation via FTP: =

1. Upload the **minify-html-markup** folder to the **/wp-content/plugins/** directory.
2. Activate the plugin from the **Plugins** screen in your WordPress admin area.

= To upload the plugin through WordPress, instead of FTP: =

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are there any settings for Minify HTML? =

Yes.  Under the **Settings** menu in the admin console there's a **Minify HTML** menu item which allows you to modify Minify HTML settings.

= How does it work? =

Magic, obviously! Actually, it creates an output buffer and then preforms its 'magic' on the output buffer. It kinda is like magic.

= Will it break my stuff? =

Normally, you won't notice any changes to the way the site looks in the browser. However, if you rely on white space between HTML tags (which you shouldn't be doing) you may notice very isolated elements with reduced horizontal spacing. This is because inline objects will add a few pixels of spacing if there's whitespace between the objects. I consider Minify HTML a good way of finding these style 'errors' and correcting them with proper padding or margin style.

= Is it fast? =

Plenty. On my server that's running dozens of websites, it takes 0.007 seconds to minify a page. Also, because the HTML file is smaller, it will speed up transfer and rendering times. Minify HTML doesn't use bloated external libraries that add additional overhead and therefore take longer to process.

= How much smaller will my HTML be? =

With real-world test sites, the HTML file is around 20-25% smaller. Even when using deflate/gzip compression the resulting file is around 20% smaller, speeding up download times. 

= I'm using deflate/gzip to compress HTML, do I need Minify HTML? =

With Minify HTML, the source HTML file will be smaller, therefore, it will compress faster and be even smaller once compressed. Also, even with deflate/gzip, your HTML markup will still look sloppy and amateurish. Minify HTML corrects this even for deflated/gzip transfers (and also saves another 20% in bandwidth).
