= iThemes Security is the #1 WordPress Security Plugin =

iThemes Security (formerly Better WP Security) gives you over 30+ ways to secure and protect your WordPress site. On average, 30,000 new websites are hacked each day. WordPress sites can be an easy target for attacks because of plugin vulnerabilities, weak passwords and obsolete software.

Most WordPress admins don't know they're vulnerable, but iThemes Security works to lock down Wordpress, fix common holes, stop automated attacks and strengthen user credentials. With advanced features for experienced users, our WordPress security plugin can help harden WordPress.

= iThemes Brute Force Attack Protection Network =

iThemes Security takes brute force attack protection to the next level by banning users who have tried to break into other sites from breaking into yours. The iThemes Brute Force Attack Protection Network will automatically report IP addresses of failed login attempts and will block them for a length of time necessary to protect your site based on the number of sites that have seen a similar attack.

= Warning =

Please read the installation instructions and FAQ before installing this WordPress security plugin. iThemes Security makes significant changes to your database and other site files which can be problematic, so a backup is strongly recommended before making any changes to your site with this plugin. While problems are rare, most support requests involve the failure to make a proper backup before installation.

== Installation ==

NOTE: iThemes Security makes significant changers to your database and other site files which can be problematic, so a backup is strongly recommended before making any changes to your site with this plugin. While problems are rare, most support requests involve the failure to make a proper backup before installation.

1. BEFORE YOU BEGIN: Back up your WordPress database, config file, and .htaccess file. We recommend using <a href="http://ithemes.com/purchase/backupbuddy">BackupBuddy</a>, our WordPress backup plugin for a complete site backup.
2. Upload the zip file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Unzip
4. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
5. Visit the Security menu for checklist and options

DISCLAIMER: Under no circumstances do we release this plugin with any warranty, implied or otherwise. We cannot be held responsible for any damage that might arise from the use of this plugin.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does iThemes Security require the latest WordPress version? Can't I use a slightly older version? =
* One of the best security practices for a WordPress site owner is keeping software up to date. Because of this, we only test this plugin on the latest stable version of WordPress and will only guarantee it works in the latest version.

= Will this plugin completely stop all attacks on my site? =
* No. iThemes Security is designed to help improve the security of your WordPress installation from many common attack methods, but it cannot prevent every possible attack. Nothing replaces diligence and good practice. This plugin makes it a little easier for you to apply both.

= Is this plugin only for new WordPress installs or can I use it on existing sites, too? =
* Many of the changes made by this plugin are complex and can break existing sites. While iThemes Security can be installed on either a new or existing site, we strongly recommend making a <a href="http://ithemes.com/purchase/backupbuddy" target="_blank">complete backup</a> of your existing site before applying any features included in this plugin.

= Will this plugin work on all servers and hosts? =
* iThemes Security requires Apache or LiteSpeed and mod_rewrite or NGINX to work.
* While this plugin should work on all hosts with Apache or LiteSpeed and mod_rewrite or NGINX, it has been known to experience problems in shared hosting environments where it runs out of resources such as available CPU or RAM. For this reason, it is extremely important that you make a backup of your site before installing on any existing site. If you run out of resources during an operation such as renaming your database table, you may need your backup to be able to restore access to your site.
* Finally, please make sure you have adequate RAM if you plan to use the file change detector or make large backups.

= Does this work with network or multisite installations? =
* Yes. We're in the process of developing more documentation, so we'll update this as soon as it's ready.

= Can I help? =
* Of course! We are in constant need of testers. In addition, we can always use help with translations for internationalization. <a href="http://ithemes.com/contributing-to-ithemes-security/">For more information on contributing to iThemes Security, visit this page</a>.

= What changes does this plugin make that can break my site? =
* iThemes Security makes significant changes to your database and other site files which can be problematic for existing WordPress sites. Again, we strongly recommended making a complete backup of your site before using this plugin. While problems are rare, most support requests involve the failure to make a proper backup before installation. DISCLAIMER: Under no circumstances do we release this plugin with any warranty, implied or otherwise. We cannot be held responsible for any damage that might arise from the use of this plugin.
* Note that renaming the wp-content directory will not update the path in existing content. Use this feature only on new sites or in a situation where you can easily update all existing links.

* <a href="http://ithemes.com/what-is-changed-by-ithemes-security/">What is Changed By iThemes Security</a>

= I've enabled the Enforce SSL option, and it broke my site. How do I get back in? =
* Open your wp-config.php file in a text editor and remove the following 2 lines:
* define('FORCE_SSL_LOGIN', true);
* define('FORCE_SSL_ADMIN', true);

= Where can I get help if something goes wrong? =
* Official support for this plugin is available for <a href="http://ithemes.com/security/" target="_blank">iThemes Security Pro</a> customers. Our team of experts is ready to help.

Free support may be available with the help of the community in the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/ithemes-security" target="_blank">WordPress.org support forums</a> (Note: this is community-provided support. iThemes does not monitor the WordPress.org support forums).

 * Bug Fix: Fixed bug that prevents wp-admin/install.php blocking from working properly on nginx servers.
 * Bug Fix: Don't attempt to do an SSL redirect when WP CLI is running.

= 6.6.0 =
 * New Feature: Added a new setting in WordPress Tweaks: "Login with Email Address or Username".
 * Enhancement: Host email images from the plugin instead of relying on iThemes servers to help email clients marking messages as spam or blocking images.
 * Bug Fix: Error when searching for modules preventing modules from appearing.

 * Misc: Rearranged modules to be listed alphabetically.

= 6.5.1 =
 * Bug Fix: Fixed logical error that prevented backups from executing.
 * Bug Fix: Fixed issue that could cause database locks to flood the database.

= 6.5.0 =
 * Enhancement: Simplified the SSL module to offer a simple Enable/Disable setting and simplified explanations. The legacy settings are available by selecting Advanced.
 * Enhancement: Added the itsec-get-ip filter to allow code to supply the remote IP directly.
 * Enhancement: Enabling SSL support will only log you out if you are not already on an https connection.
 * Enhancement: Improve password requirements compatibility with plugins and systems that integrate with WordPress Users.
 * Removed Old Feature: Removed the "Replace jQuery With a Safe Version" feature as its use (protecting against a specific jQuery bug: https://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9521) is many years old and is no longer a concern.
 * Bug Fix: Bumped version number of some scripts to ensure that they refresh properly.
 * Bug Fix: Fixed way to work around Hide Backend on some hosts.

= 6.4.0 =
 * Enhancement: Replaced file locking with database locking. This method of locking is compatible with all systems as it does not require the ability to write files. It also allows for locking to work on sites that have multiple front-end servers with a shared database. Since file locking is no longer used, the Global Settings > Disable File Locking setting was removed.
 * Enhancement: Add "Copy to Clipboard" functionality for server and wp-config rules.
 * Bug Fix: Prevent 404s when following links in email notifications on a site with Hide Backend enabled.
 * Bug Fix: Ensure uninstall process is not run when another version of iThemes Security is still active.
 * Bug Fix: Fixed method of working around Hide Backend.
 * Bug Fix: Warnings are no longer generated when saving a user profile with a role of "No role for this site" selected.

= 6.3.0 =
 * Important: The way that Hide Backend functions changes in this release. Previously, if your Hide Backend Login Slug was wplogin, going to example.com/wplogin would result in the URL remaining example.com/wplogin. The new implementation of this feature results in a redirect to a URL that looks as follows: example.com/wp-login.php?itsec-hb-token=wplogin. While this may not be desireable for some users, this change was necessary to fix longstanding compatibility issues with other plugins. Once you access the login page using the Login Slug page, a cookie is set with an expiration time of one hour. As long as the cookie remains, you can access example.com/wp-login.php without having to access the Hide Backend Login Slug first. If you wish to confirm that Hide Backend is working properly on your site, opening up a private browsing window is a quick way to test without having to log out and clear cookies.
 * New Feature: Added support for iThemes Sync to run the Security Check feature from inside the Sync service.
 * New Feature: Added support for the ITSEC_DISABLE_MODULES define.
