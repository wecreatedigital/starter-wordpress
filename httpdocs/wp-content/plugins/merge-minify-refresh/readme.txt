Merges/Concatenates CSS & Javascript and then minifies using Minify (for CSS) and Google Closure (for JS with Minify as a fallback).

== Description ==

This plugin merges/concatenates Cascading Style Sheets & Javascript files into groups. It then minifies the generated files using Minify (for CSS) and Google Closure (for JS - fallback to Minify when not available). Minification is done via WP-Cron so that it doesn't slow down the website. When JS or CSS changes files are re-processed. No need to empty cache!

Inspired by [MinQueue](https://wordpress.org/plugins/minqueue/) and [Dependency Minification](https://wordpress.org/plugins/dependency-minification) plugins.

Minification by [Minify](https://github.com/matthiasmullie/minify) and [Google Closure](https://developers.google.com/closure/)

In order to ensure fast loading times its recommended to set long expiry dates for CSS and JS as well as make sure gzip or deflate is on.

Version 1.6 added support for HTTP2 Server Push to further speed up your requests (thanks to [Daniel Aleksandersen](https://www.slightfuture.com)).

Version 1.6.9 added the ability to specify the cache directory. Set MMR_CACHE_DIR & MMR_CACHE_URL constants in wp-config.php. MMR_CACHE_DIR must be full server path and MMR_CACHE_URL must be absolute URL for this to work correctly (thanks to [Daniel Aleksandersen](https://www.slightfuture.com)).

Version 1.6.11 added the ability to specify seperate cache urls for javascript and CSS. Use MMR_JS_CACHE_URL & MMR_CSS_CACHE_URL to replace MMR_CACHE_URL. 

Version 1.7.0 added the ability to generate .css.gz & .js.gz files. Your webserver may need to be configured to use these files. Here is how to use these files in Apache:
`
&#35;Serve gzip compressed CSS files if they exist and the client accepts gzip.
RewriteCond %{HTTP:Accept-encoding} gzip
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}\.gz -s
RewriteRule ^(.*)\.css $1\.css\.gz [QSA]

&#35;Serve gzip compressed JS files if they exist and the client accepts gzip.
RewriteCond %{HTTP:Accept-encoding} gzip
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}\.gz -s
RewriteRule ^(.*)\.js $1\.js\.gz [QSA]

&#35;Serve correct content types, and prevent mod_deflate double gzip.
RewriteRule \.css\.gz$ - [T=text/css,E=no-gzip:1,E=is_gzip:1]
RewriteRule \.js\.gz$ - [T=text/javascript,E=no-gzip:1,E=is_gzip:1]
Header set Content-Encoding "gzip" env=is_gzip
`
Version 1.8.8 added a "merge_minify_refresh_done" hook that fires when JS or CSS has changed.

**Note** Installing this plugin on a server with the eAccellerator module installed has the potential to break as Minify uses anonymous functions which return NULL. [View eAccellerator Issue Thread](https://github.com/eaccelerator/eaccelerator/issues/12)

**Features**

*	Merges JS and CSS files to reduce the number of HTTP requests
